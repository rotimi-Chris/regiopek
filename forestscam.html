           <h2> Everything You Have Been Wanting To Know About Forex Scams </h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>Forex, or the foreign exchange market where investors and institutions trade currencies,
            is the biggest financial market in the world. According to a 2019 Triennial Central Bank Survey report, around $6.5 trillion trades each day on the forex markets. However, while forex trading is legal, the industry is rife with scams and bad actors.
            Investors need to do their due diligence before venturing into what can be a Wild West version of global financial markets. It will take a trained eye to see a forex scam because of its complexity. But don’t worry. We are here
             to help you identify this type of scam, so you do not fall victim. 
        </p>
            <br><br>
        <h2>What is Forex Trading?</h2> <br><br>
        <img src="trading-chart.jpg" alt="">
        <br><br>
        <p>Forex, also known as FX trading, simply deals with the fluctuations in exchange rates, and if you are planning to invest in it, you need a forex brokerage account. The forex market is an international market where currencies are traded 24 hours a day, five times a week, Monday till Friday. No physical exchange occurs; hence all currency trading is done over the counter (OTC) (as there is for stocks). Making predictions on currency values to generate a profit is known as forex trading. 

            Thus, in simpler words, forex trading is exchanging one currency for another. Currency exchange helps with international travel, conducting international business, foreign trade, etc. Trade flows economic, political, and geopolitical developments, all of which affect forex supply and demand, influence the value of a currency pair. This results in daily volatility, which may present new chances for forex traders. There are 180 currencies in the world. The need to exchange the equivalent value of one currency for another is why forex trade exists.  Unfortunately, the forex market is unregulated, which has allowed the infiltration of scammers. The forex market is the largest globally because it comprises every country’s currency. Today, Forex Scams also offer traders the thought they are investing in stocks, commodities, and other securities. But, sadly, they are not investing in anything but merely lured into a forex scam.
            
            Brokers aren’t usually the ones that represent Forex scammers. Individual actors without firms who position themselves as broker companies are more likely to be involved. They have frequently seasoned Internet users capable of fabricating misleading information on the sites they construct. The owners of such scam websites do not have a license and are hence unregulated. They may not even have a fundamental understanding of the Forex market. However, not everything is clear to a beginner trader who does not have a background in economics or finance. Fraudulent promotional schemes and overstatement of returns give rise to forex scams that can prove extremely dangerous. Scammers are often individuals without companies pretending to be broker companies. Without any license, education, and even basic knowledge of the forex market, they can suffer huge losses worth millions with fabricated false information. However, identifying forex scams today is not as difficult as it used to be. If a company promises you big profits, has fake ratings, seems like a dubious business with no reputable reputation and unprofessional practices,
            know right away that it’s a trap! </p> <br><br>

            <img src="trader-and-chart.jpg" alt="">
           <h2> The Effects of Forex Scams on Victims</h2> 
           <p> Forex scams have taken an emotional toll on victims to a great
            extent. According to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Foundation report, almost two-thirds of fraud victims experience at least one severe emotional consequence, including stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. It not only affects you financially but emotionally and mentally as well.
            </p> <br><br>
           <p> Fortunately, in current times, after being scammed, you might be able to get your money back with the legal and emotional support available through the recovery firms. We do not take the emotional impact of scams/frauds lightly. Victims of fraud go through intense shame and guilt for being so naive, and most of them end up in severe depression because of the loss. If you’re a victim, know that what happened is not your fault and the Zonalspy is here to help you get back on your feet. We at Zonalspy will work
            diligently with our skilled staff and technology to prepare legal papers to reclaim your monies. Don’t worry; we’ve got you! </p>
<br><br>
           <h2> Types of Forex Scams to be Aware of These Days!</h2>
           
        <p>As mentioned earlier, the forex market has no international regulatory body (or bodies), so there has been an alarming rate of scamming activities. There are regulations related to Europe, American treaties, and Asian ones. Still, there is no global authority to handle international forex scams due to the difference between the client location, the broker location, and the sales office performing the fraud. So, unfortunately, you are vulnerable as a forex trader. However, you should be aware of some signs and types of forex scams so you don’t become a victim. </p>
